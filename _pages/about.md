I have been actively involved in research areas including medical informatics, healthcare informatics and medical big data and artificial intelligence. Our goal is to transform clinical practice and enhance healthcare quality through the application of information technology. My research interests focus on machine learning and data mining, with particular emphasis on their applications in trustworthy artificial intelligence (such as interpretability, robustness, domain generalization, causal inference, and uncertainty quantification) and computational medicine (including predictive modeling, medical imaging, and real-world evidence).
